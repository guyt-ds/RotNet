Citi can migrate its existing off-chain client-due-diligence stack—identity verification, KYC/AML, credit-risk analytics and asset-valuation—to an on-chain credential layer.
Using the open ERC-3643 permissioned-token standard and its companion ONCHAINID, every customer completes compliance once, receives a blockchain wallet bound to verifiable credentials, and can immediately interact with any Citi-approved real-world-asset (RWA) token—starting with fractional fine art.
This shift collapses multiple siloed processes into a single programmable rail, reduces re-work, creates an auditable history of risk decisions, and positions Citi as the trusted identity “spine” for a tokenised financial market.


## 1 From off-chain procedures to on-chain credentials

### 1.1 Core credential types Citi can issue

| Procedure today                       | On-chain primitive                             | Standard / tooling                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Government-ID, proof-of-address (KYC) | **Legal-identity claim** attached to ONCHAINID | ERC-3643 & ONCHAINID smart contract ([Tokeny][1])                                                                                        |
| AML / sanctions screening             | **Compliance score** updated by Citi oracle    | FATF Travel-Rule data model ([Sumsub][2])                                                                                                |
| Credit bureau score                   | **Credit-risk Soulbound Token (SBT)**          | TransUnion-Spring Labs pilot ([TransUnion Newsroom][3]); Spectral Finance on-chain score ([Alchemy][4]); Masa hybrid score ([GitHub][5]) |
| Accredited-investor status            | **Eligibility claim** revocable on-chain       | ERC-734/735 claim registry ([Medium][6])                                                                                                 |
| Source-of-wealth attestation          | **Proof-of-funds credential**                  | KILT verifiable-credential toolkit ([KILT][7])                                                                                           |

Each claim is a verifiable credential stored in the client’s ONCHAINID; smart-contracts read those claims before allowing any transfer of a permissioned token.



## 3 Art tokenisation as the flagship use-case

### 3.1 Custody & provenance

* Citi secures the painting in a free-port vault; a tamper-evident digital twin is hashed on-chain ([Citi][10]).
* Precedent: Maecenas tokenised 31.5 % of Warhol’s *14 Small Electric Chairs* for \$1.7 m in 2018 ([blog.maecenas.co][11]), while Masterworks has securitised > \$1 bn art under SEC Regulation A + ([FinTech Weekly - Home Page][12]).

### 3.2 Token issuance

* Citi mints an ERC-3643 security-token representing 100 % economic interest. Each fraction inherits transfer-rules tied to client credentials.

### 3.3 Ongoing valuation

* Monthly, Sotheby’s-certified appraisers deliver a price; Citi’s oracle posts the new fair value to Chainlink-compatible feeds so DeFi pools and investors see a single truth source ([Chainlink][13], [Medium][14]).

### 3.4 Liquidity & leverage

* Tokens can trade on regulated ATS venues that already support ERC-3643 (e.g., 21X, Tokeny) ([Aventus][15]).
* Holders can borrow stablecoins using art tokens as collateral; loan smart-contracts continuously verify the owner’s credit SBT and art price feed.


## 1  Credit-bureau score → Credit-risk Soulbound Token (SBT)

### What it is

A *non-transferable* token—minted to the client’s wallet—that encodes either a raw bureau score (e.g., 710) or a risk tier (A/B/C).  Because it cannot move, lenders know the score really belongs to that wallet owner.

### How it’s being done today

| Pilot                                   | Approach                                                                                                                                                                                 | Why it matters                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **TransUnion × Spring Labs × Quadrata** | TransUnion packages off-chain bureau data; Spring Labs hashes it and delivers it to wallets as a “ky0x Digital Passport” credential ([TransUnion Newsroom][1], [TransUnion Newsroom][2]) | Brings a top-three U.S. bureau directly into DeFi pools without revealing raw PII.         |
| **Spectral Finance**                    | Calculates a *MACRO Score* from the borrower’s on-chain history and issues it as a non-transferable NFT ([Samsung Next][3], [Alchemy][4])                                                | Purely blockchain-native credit model already integrated by several lending dApps.         |
| **Masa Finance**                        | Mints a *hybrid* SBT that aggregates on-chain behaviour **and** optional off-chain bureau or bank feeds ([GitHub][5], [Medium][6])                                                       | Shows how Web2 data and Web3 data can coexist in one credential for emerging-market users. |

### Why Citi cares

*Existing credit-risk rules (LTV, pricing, limits) can read the SBT on-chain; no PDF uploads, no manual review.*
If a score drops, Citi burns the old token and issues a new one—every liquidity pool instantly sees the change.

## 2  Accredited-investor status → Revocable **Eligibility claim**

### Technical standard

*ERC-734 / ERC-735* define an on-chain **claim registry**.  An attester (e.g., Citi Private Bank) signs a structured statement such as *“Wallet 0xABC qualifies under SEC Rule 501(a)(5)”* and writes it to the customer’s ONCHAINID contract ([docs.onchainid.com][7], [Medium][8]).  Claims can be **revoked** if circumstances change.

### Regulatory context

The SEC requires issuers to maintain a “reasonable belief” that each buyer is accredited ([SEC][9], [Morgan Lewis][10]).  A signed on-chain claim—timestamped and linked to KYC files—provides an auditable trail and can be checked automatically by any ERC-3643 security-token before transfer.

### Emerging experiments

* Substack research shows how a Soulbound “Accredited Investor” token can satisfy Rule 506(c) verification while preserving privacy ([l2ivresearch.substack.com][11]).
* Tokeny’s ERC-3643 white-paper adopts ERC-734/735 claims for exactly this purpose, embedding them into its permissioned-token flow ([Tokeny][12], [docs.erc3643.org][13]).

## 3  Source-of-wealth / Source-of-funds → “Proof-of-Funds” verifiable credential

### Role in compliance

AML rules often demand evidence of how the customer acquired the money they invest.  Today this is a PDF bank statement; on-chain it can be a *verifiable credential* whose hash is stored in a DID.

### KILT Protocol toolkit

KILT is a Polkadot-based identity blockchain that lets *trusted attesters* issue, revoke and verify rich credentials while the underlying documents stay private ([KILT][14], [docs.kilt.io][15], [kilt-protocol.org][16]).

* A bank (or audit firm) reviews the documents, signs a “Proof-of-Funds” statement, and writes only the hash + metadata to the customer’s wallet.
* Any smart contract can call KILT’s verification API to confirm the credential is valid without ever seeing the documents.

### Why it matters for Citi

*Enables art-buyers (or any RWA investor) to prove large legitimate wealth once, then reuse that proof across all Citi token offerings.*
Third-party vaults, Sotheby’s appraisers or even external exchanges could all rely on the same credential.
